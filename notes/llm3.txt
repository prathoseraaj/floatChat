    The user asked: "{user_query}".
    Here is a sample of the first 50 rows of the data:
    {data_sample}

    Task: Generate a JSON object for a Plotly chart that visualizes the FULL dataset's structure based on this sample.
    - The JSON should be a dictionary with 'data' and 'layout' keys.
    - Choose the best chart type (e.g., scatter, line, scatter_mapbox).
    - If the user asks about location, a 'scatter_mapbox' is best. Use latitude and longitude.
    - For profiles, a scatter plot of temperature or salinity vs. pressure (depth) is best. Invert the y-axis for pressure.
    - Make the chart visually appealing with clear titles and labels.
    - Respond with ONLY the JSON object and nothing else.
